# rolabola
Unity 3D project based on Unity tutorial Roll-a-ball. Made to be presented as final test for Digital Game Programming course on IFPA-TADS carreer.

# What it does:
You control the Ball to catch all golden blocks around the screen within countdown time. If you do it, it takes you to the next and more challenging level.

# Advantages
If you new to Unity3D, you can use this project to learn about engine physics, forces, sound, timers, scenes and Camera positions.

# 3rd party Assets
The background music is from SEGA Genesis Streets of Rage opening theme. Since this is not a commercial project, hope it causes not problem. All other assets are jpg images used as texture for the ball, background tabletop and walls.
