# rolabola
Unity 3D project based on Unity tutorial Roll-a-ball. Made to be presented as final test for Digital Game Programming course on IFPA Systems Analysis and Development Graduation.

# What it does:
You control the Ball to catch all golden blocks around the screen within countdown time. If you do it, it takes you to the next and more challenging level.

# Advantages
If you're new to Unity3D, you can use this project to learn about engine physics, forces, sound, timers, scenes and Camera positions.

# 3rd party Assets
The background music is from SEGA Genesis Streets of Rage opening theme. Since this is not a commercial project, hope it causes not problem. All other assets are jpg images used as texture for the ball, background, tabletop, ramps and walls. 

# Platforms
The game was intended to run in Android phones with Android Marshmallow (Version 6 - API Level 23), but using Unity3D, you can deploy it on Windows, WebGL, Linux, and other supported platforms. At ./Build/Android/ directory, it have a builded apk for testing. You can copy it directly to your Android Device an play it using accelerometer. It's most challenging and fun in phones, because it's very difficult to control the ball tilting correctly the phone. Try it and feel it by yourself!
